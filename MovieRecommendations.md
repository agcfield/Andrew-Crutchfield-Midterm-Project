A childhood favorite and one I still love to this day. This film has everything: action, character drama, heart-wrenching emotion, themes of political corruption, a fantastic score, and **Palpatine**.

## 4. 12 Angry Men (1957)

It's amazing how this movie is able to create such an interesting and emotional story, despite taking place in just one small room full of twelve guys just talking. Truly awesome.

## 3. Whiplash (2014)

This movie masterfully explores the idea of obsession and realization of one's true potential. It's also got great music with perhaps the greatest final scene in any movie ever.

## 2. No Country for Old Men (2007)

I have seen this movie over five times at this point and I couldn't tell you for the life of me why I keep coming back to it. Maybe it's because of the villain that you just can't help but be fascinated, and utterly disturbed by at the same time. Maybe it's the fact that there's no music throughout the entire movie which gives it this uniquely immersive and realistic feel. Maybe it's the endearing and naturalistic extras that don't feel like actors in the slightest. All I know is that each time I watch it, I'm just as engrossed as I was the first time I saw it.

## 1. Cool Hand Luke (1967)

I wrote an analysis essay on this movie for a film class a few semesters ago, and after coming to appreciate its brilliant use of character and stylist film elements, it's been my favorite movie ever since.
