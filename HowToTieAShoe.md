# How to Tie a Shoe

Below you will find a step-by-step guide to tying a shoe. This is a very complex process, so pay close attention. 

1. Slip an individual item of footwear, commonly referred to as a "shoe", over one of your two feet.
2. Once the shoe is fitted, pinch each of the shoe's shoelaces betwixt the thumb and index finger of each of your hands.
3. Cross each shoelace over to the opposite side of the shoe so that they are hanging off the sides.
4. Take the shoelace resting farthest from you and tuck it under the shoelace closest to you. Now *PULL* it!
5. Take the shoelace you have just pulled through and create a "loop" shape. It should resemble the ear of a oryctolagus cuniculus.
6. Next, take the other lonely shoelace and wrap it around the looped one, starting on the side facing you.
7. This is where it gets tricky. After the unlooped shoelace is wrapped around the looped one, take your other hand, grab the unlooped lace (not directly from the end) and *PULL* it **underneath itself**.
8. If you did this correctly, you should now have a tied shoe. Now go walk somewhere.
